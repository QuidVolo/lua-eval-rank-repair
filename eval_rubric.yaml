# eval_rubric.yaml â€” simple weights for ranking
weights:
  correctness: 5
  readability: 4
  idiomatic: 3
  performance: 3
  testability: 4
notes:
  - Guard zero distance and NaN/Inf propagation
  - Prefer pure/pure-ish small functions (easier to test)
  - Avoid hidden globals; use locals/modules
  - Clamp steps to avoid jitter/overshoot
  - Return booleans/flags that help callers write simple state machines
